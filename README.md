## Hello, I am Yoan Antonio 👋👦🏻
I am a software engineer pleased of working in the Semantic Web area. I am also a professor at the University of Informatics Science (UCI). I have taught Mathematics, Networks and Security, Programing. Currently, I am a PhD student (Joint UCI-Ghent) and part of a team that is immersed in developing a linked open data platform for the UCI, so, if you like topics like semantic web, ontologies, linked data, knowledge graph embedding... WELCOME to our team!!!🍇

#### Linked university platform
What good does it do to have a linked open university platform? 
-Representation and integration of data,
-Reuse of data,
-Building effective, integrated, and innovative applications over its datasets,
-Revealing the contribution and achievements as LOD which is nowadays a mean to measure the university reputation.
=> 
-University staff improvement.
